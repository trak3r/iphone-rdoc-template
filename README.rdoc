= iPhone RDoc Template

== What is it?

It's an RDoc template tailored to look better in the iPhone web browser (no frames, a lot less styling, native app feel thanks to iUI library, etc.).

== Are there any external dependencies?

Yup, the aforementioned iUI library http://code.google.com/p/iui/

== How do I use it?

Download it then write yourself a Rake task like the one provided (changing the appropriate paths, of course).

== Caveats

For the sake of simplicity, I removed the source code links and embedding.

== Thanks

I referred to the following projects when I got lost and confused:

I borrowed CSS and some graphics from:
