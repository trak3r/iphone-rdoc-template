= What is it?

It's an RDoc template that's tailored to look better in the iPhone web browser.

== How to generate for Rails

  cd <your rails directory>
  rake rerdoc template=<your path to iphone_rdoc_template>/iphone_rdoc_template

(Note: It's important to leave off the ".rb" extension as the Rails Rake task will append it to the path.)
