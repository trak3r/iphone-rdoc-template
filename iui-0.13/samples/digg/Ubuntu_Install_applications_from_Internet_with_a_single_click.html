    <h2>Ubuntu: Install applications from Internet with a single-click.</h2>
    <p>"With this new feature it will be possible to install applications just by clicking in a link that point to a new apt:// protocol, it will call a dialog asking if the user really wants to install that package, if yes the superuser password will be asked and the package will be installed. Itâ€™s simple like that :)"</p>
