    <h2>Two of our three iPhones have faulty batteries (pics)</h2>
    <p>We've been trying to run tests on our official WirelessInfo.com iPhones since the device hit the streets, but we've been running into battery anomalies. Most recently we've found that two out of our three iPhones won't charge fully.  Are you experiencing similar problems?</p>
