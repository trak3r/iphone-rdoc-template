    <h2>iPhone in depth: the Ars Technica review</h2>
    <p>Our iPhone review is rather large because we unleashed three (and a half) reviewers on it, all coming from different backgrounds. We pooled our thoughts together, had a few fistfights and a squabble or two ("Keyboard sucks!" "Does not!"), and now present to you our full review. Check out the outline beforehand, or just jump on in.</p>
