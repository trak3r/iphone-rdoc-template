    <h2>Bush on Health Care: It's All Your Fault</h2>
    <p>Bush spoke in Ohio today and blames YOU for lawsuits on doctors, not choosing the correct health plan, being in poor health…it goes on and on. His new talking point is the “Federalization of health care.” The medical industry is freaking since Moore’s movie just came out. They need you dumbed down and Bush tries to do that for them.</p>
