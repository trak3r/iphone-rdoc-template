    <h2>Rumor Smash: Actually, the iPhone Battery WON'T Die After 400 Charges</h2>
    <p>Some good news for the iPhone's battery. Everyone originally reported that the iPhone battery loses capacity after 300-400 charges, needing to be replaced. People were mad. Turns out, that's bullshit. Apple tells us that the battery life "is designed to retain 80% of its original capacity after 400 full charge and discharge cycles."</p>
